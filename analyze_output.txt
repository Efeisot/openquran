Resolving dependencies...
Note: intl is pinned to version 0.20.2 by flutter_localizations from the flutter SDK.
See https://dart.dev/go/sdk-version-pinning for details.


Because every version of flutter_localizations from sdk depends on intl 0.20.2 and flutter_application_1 depends on intl ^0.18.1, flutter_localizations from sdk is forbidden.
So, because flutter_application_1 depends on flutter_localizations from sdk, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your constraint on intl: flutter pub add intl:^0.20.2
Failed to update packages.
